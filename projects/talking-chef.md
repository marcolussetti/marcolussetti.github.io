summary:  Developed an experimental recipe application centered on voice-recognition. Application was developed as a native Android application using Java and the Android NDK. The app employs voice-recognition to allow the user to issue vocal commands to the application. This is indented for hands-free operation while the user is cooking. The application uses Realm as an object storage for its underlying user-submitted data.
